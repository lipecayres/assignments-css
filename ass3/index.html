                <h1>Twix - Caramel, biscuit and chocolate</h1>
                <small>TWIX is an awesome combination of crunchy cookie, delicious caramel and creamy chocolate. Perfect
                    for sharing.</small>
                <p>Once upon a time, brothers Earl and Seamus were united by an extraordinary idea: to combine cookie,
                    caramel and chocolate into one beautiful bar. But even as they developed their big idea, their
                    differences were evident. Both perfectionists, Seamus and Earl clashed on everything from
                    chocolate-pouring technique to caramel consistency. The final straw came at the Grand Unveiling of
                    their new TWIX bar. Tensions reached a breaking point and the bar snapped. So too did the brothers’
                    tempers and the occasion quickly descended into fisticuffs. Unable to reach an agreement and with
                    neither willing to give way, the brothers had no choice: they had to divide the company. Earl rode
                    away as far as possible to establish his enterprise, but found himself only yards from Seamus’s
                    chosen plot. Each designed a unique building to house his factory, and each sneered at the
                    mediocrity of the factory opposite. The two took distinctively different approaches to the
                    manufacture of chocolate, finally able to do it their own way. Left TWIX became a crunchy cookie
                    base upon which caramel was flowed before being bathed in chocolate. Meanwhile Right TWIX was a
                    cascade of caramel on a crisp cookie base, cloaked in chocolate. Seamus and Earl were destined never
                    to reconcile. And although a handful of wrappers from their time as partners still remain to this
                    day, never again would a Left and a Right TWIX sit beside one another.</p>
