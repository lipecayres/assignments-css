        <p> You're just too good to be true </p>
        <p> I can't take my eyes off you</p>
        <p> You'd be like heaven to touch</p>
        <p> I wanna hold you so much</p>
        <p> At long last love has arrived</p>
        <p> And I thank God I'm alive</p>
        <p> You're just too good to be true</p>
        <p> Can't take my eyes off you</p>
        <br>
        <p> Pardon the way that I stare</p>
        <p> There's nothing else to compare</p>
        <p> The sight of you leaves me weak</p>
        <p> There are no words left to speak</p>
        <p> But if you feel like I feel</p>
        <p> Please let me know that it's real</p>
        <p> You're just too good to be true</p>
        <p> I can't take my eyes off you</p>
        <br>
        <p> I love you, baby</p>
        <p> And if it's quite all right</p>
        <p> I need you, baby</p>
        <p> To warm the lonely nights</p>
        <p> I love you, baby</p>
        <p> Trust in me when I say</p>
        <br>
        <p> Oh, pretty baby</p>
        <p> Don't bring me down I pray</p>
        <p> Oh, pretty baby</p>
        <p> Now that I've found you, stay </p>
        <p> And let me love you, baby </p>
        <p> Let me love you</p>
        <br>
        <p> You're just too good to be true </p>
        <p> I can't take my eyes off you</p>
        <p> You'd be like heaven to touch</p>
        <p> I wanna hold you so much</p>
        <p> At long last love has arrived</p>
        <p> And I thank God I'm alive</p>
